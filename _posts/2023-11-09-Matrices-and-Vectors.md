# Matrix
A matrix (_plural, matrices_) is a rectangular array of scalars. In general, we say that the size of the matrix is **_m_ by _n_** if the matrix has m rows and n columns. If m = n we can say this matrix is square. The scalar in the $i$_th_ row and $j$_th_ column is called the **$(i, j)$-entry** of the matrix.
