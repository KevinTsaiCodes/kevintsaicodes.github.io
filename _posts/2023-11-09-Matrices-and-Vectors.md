# Matrix

## Definition
A matrix (_plural, matrices_) is a rectangular array of scalars. In general, we say that the size of the matrix is _m_ by _n_ if the matrix has m rows and n columns. If _m = n_ we can say this matrix is square. The scalar in the $i$_th_ row and $j$_th_ column is called the **$(i, j)$**-entry of the matrix.

### Zero-Matrix
A zero matrix or null matrix is a matrix all of whose entries are zero.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Identity Matrix
An identity Matrix is the matrix which is a square matrix where the diagonal consist of ones and the other elements are all zeros. It is also called as a _Unit Matrix_ or _Elementary Matrix_.

$$
I_{1} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
I_{2} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
I_{3} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
