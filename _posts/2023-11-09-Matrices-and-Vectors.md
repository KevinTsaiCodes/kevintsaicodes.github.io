# Matrix

## Definition
A matrix (_plural, matrices_) is a rectangular array of scalars. In general, we say that the size of the matrix is _m_ by _n_ if the matrix has m rows and n columns. If _m = n_ we can say this matrix is square. The scalar in the $i$_th_ row and $j$_th_ column is called the **$(i, j)$**-entry of the matrix.

### Zero-Matrix
A zero matrix or null matrix is a matrix all of whose entries are zero.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$
